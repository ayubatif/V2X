# V2X

Code used for experimental data collection. Prior to running the tests, n number of certificates are generated for OBU-X and OBU-N using the PseudonymAuthority class in the jar file. The X509 certificates are generated using code similar to what is displayed in the BASH directory. 

Once the certificates have been loaded into their respective directories, the setup files are zipped and transferred to hardware units for running the experiment.
